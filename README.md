## Purpose

The purpose of this code is to get a hello-world app running using React, Babel, and Webpack. This will be the basis for building our calculator app. 

### Setup and Run

Run `$ npm install` to install all the node modules specified in package.json.

Hot reload for webpack is not yet enabled. If you make a change to a file in the app directory, you need to manually run webpack to recompile. To rerun webpack, run the command `$ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack -d`
